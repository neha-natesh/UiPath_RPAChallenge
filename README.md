Go to http://rpachallenge.com
Click the "Download Excel" button to download a file containing 10 rows with user data 
Create a workflow that will input the data from each of the spreadsheet rows into the form on the web page
Beware! Every time the form is submitted, the form fields will change order and position on the web page! The workflow must correctly identify where the data must be entered every time!
The challenge is to get all the 10 rows of spreadsheet data submitted on the web page as quickly as possible.

The clock starts when you click the "Start" button; until then, you can submit the form as many times as you want.
